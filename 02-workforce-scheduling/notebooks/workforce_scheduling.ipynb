    "## Business Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of workforce scheduling is to assign workers to shifts in a way\n",
    "that satisfies all operational requirements while producing a\n",
    "reasonable and balanced schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- A set of workers with specific skills and availability\n",
    "- A set of shifts that must be covered\n",
    "- Staff requirements specifying how many workers are needed per shift\n",
    "- Skill requirements specifying which skills must be present in each shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision maker must determine which workers should be assigned to\n",
    "which shifts. Each assignment decision is binary: a worker is either assigned to a\n",
    "shift or not. Fractional assignments are not meaningful in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "A schedule is considered **valid** if:\n",
    "- Every shifts are covered\n",
    "- Skill requirements are satisfied\n",
    "- Workers are only assigned to shifts for which they are available\n",
    "- No worker is assigned to more than one shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among all feasible schedules, some are preferable to others based on\n",
    "criteria such as fairness and worker shift preferences.\n",

    "## Modeling Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This workforce scheduling problem is modeled as a binary optimization\n",
    "problem and formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Binary decision variables indicate whether a particular worker\n",
    "is assigned to a particular shift.\n",

    "The model includes:\n",
    "- **Staff constraints** to ensure that each shift has sufficient\n",
    "  staffing\n",
    "- **Skill constraints** to ensure that required skills are present in\n",
    "  each shift\n",
    "- **Availability constraints** to prevent assigning workers to shifts\n",
    "  they cannot work\n",
    "- **Assignment constraints** to avoid overlapping or excessive\n",
    "  assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these hard feasibility constraints, the model will later\n",
    "incorporate soft constraints using penalty terms to improve schedule\n",
    "quality, such as balancing workload or respecting worker preferences on shifts.\n"

    "## Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents the mathematical formulation of the\n",
    "workforce scheduling problem. The formulation translates the business\n",
    "requirements into decision variables, constraints, and objective\n",
    "function suitable for an optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sets\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mathcal{W} &: \\text{Set of workers, }w\\in\\mathcal{W}\\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{S} &: \\text{Set of shifts, }s\\in\\mathcal{S}\\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{K} &: \\text{Set of skills, }k\\in\\mathcal{K}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters\n",

    "0,~ &\\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "**Interpretation:** It indicates whether a worker is assigned to a given shift.\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\min\\sum_{w\\in\\mathcal{W}}\\sum_{s\\in\\mathcal{S}}~x_{ws}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "**Interpretation:** Although the primary purpose of the model is to ensure feasibility, this objective term plays an important role by preventing unnecessary overstaffing and guiding the solver toward solutions that use the minimum number of worker assignments required to satisfy all operational constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints\n",
    "1. Staff Requirement Constraints: \\begin{equation}\\sum_{w\\in\\mathcal{W}} x_{ws} \\geq n_s, \\enspace \\forall s\\in\\mathcal{S}\\end{equation} **Interpretation:** Each shift must have at least the required number of workers.\n",
    "2. Availability Constraints: \\begin{equation} x_{ws} \\leq a_{ws},\\enspace\\forall w\\in\\mathcal{W},\\forall s\\in\\mathcal{S} \\end{equation} **Interpretation:** Worker can only be assigned to shifts, for which they are available for.\n",
    "3. Skill Requirement Constraints: \\begin{equation} \\sum_{w\\in\\mathcal{W}} x_{ws}b_{wk} \\geq q_{sk},\\enspace\\forall s\\in\\mathcal{S}, \\forall k\\in\\mathcal{K} \\end{equation}  **Interpretation:** For each shift and each required skill, at least one of the assigned workers must possess that skill.\n",
    "4. Workload Balancing Constraints: \\begin{equation}\\sum_{s\\in\\mathcal{S}} x_{ws} \\leq1 ,\\enspace\\forall w\\in\\mathcal{W}.\\end{equation} **Interpretation:** Each worker can be assigned to at most one shift.\n",
    "5. Binary Constraints: \\begin{equation} x_{ws}\\in\\{0,1\\},\\enspace \\forall w\\in\\mathcal{W}, \\forall s\\in\\mathcal{S}\\end{equation}**Interpretation:** The variables are binary, since assignments are discrete decisions.\n"

    "such factors play an important role but are typically not enforced as\n",

    "formulation itself is general and can be applied to larger problem\n",
    "instances without modification, workforce scheduling problems are\n",
    "inherently combinatorial in nature. As problem size increases, solver\n",

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "- Workforce scheduling problems can be effectively modeled as binary\n",
    "  optimization problems with clearly defined feasibility constraints.\n",
    "- Hard constraints enforce operational requirements such as staffing,\n",
    "  skill coverage, availability, and assignment limits.\n",
    "- Soft constraints can be incorporated as penalty terms in the objective\n",
    "  function to improve schedule quality without sacrificing feasibility.\n",
    "- The resulting formulation is solver-independent and can be solved\n",
    "  using both open-source and commercial optimization solvers.\n",
    "- Meaningful scaling of workforce scheduling models requires advanced\n",
    "  algorithmic strategies rather than naive enlargement of problem size.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project follows a modeling-first approach aligned with real-world\n",
    "workforce scheduling practices and serves as a foundation for more\n",
