# Applied Optimization Portfolio

This repository contains applied Operations Research and Optimization projects
focused on real-world decision-making problems in supply chain, logistics,
scheduling, and energy systems.

> ⚠️ This portfolio is actively being developed.  
> Projects are added sequentially with complete documentation and reproducible
> results.

## Focus Areas
- Mathematical Optimization (LP, MILP, Stochastic, Robust)
- Optimization Modeling in Python (Pyomo)
- Solvers: CBC, HiGHS, CPLEX (Community Edition), Gurobi (trial)
- Applications: workforce scheduling, logistics, facility location, energy systems

## Completed Projects
