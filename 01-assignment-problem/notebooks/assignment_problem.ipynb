    "# Assignment Problem: Optimization for Cost-Efficient Resource Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The Assignment Problem is a fundamental optimization model in Operations Research\n",
    "used to allocate limited resources to competing tasks in an optimal manner.\n",
    "Each resource can be assigned to at most one task, and each task must be assigned\n",
    "to exactly one resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem arises in a wide range of real-world applications such as workforce\n",
    "assignment, machine-job allocation, task scheduling, and service dispatching.\n",
    "The model focuses on making discrete (yes/no) assignment decisions while minimizing\n",
    "total operational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the classical **Assignment Problem** is formulated as a\n",
    "**Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP)** and solved using both open-source and\n",
    "commercial optimization solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solvers used:**\n",
    "- CBC (open-source)\n",
    "- IBM CPLEX Community Edition\n",
    "\n",
    "To highlight the role of integrality, the notebook also examines the **LP relaxation**\n",
    "of the model and explains why binary constraints are essential for obtaining\n",

    "## Business Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "An organization must assign a set of workers to a set of tasks.\n",
    "Each worker can perform at most one task, and each task requires exactly one worker.\n",
    "Assigning a particular worker to a particular task incurs a known cost that reflects\n",
    "factors such as skill mismatch, time, or operational expense.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Goal** is to determine the optimal assignment of workers to tasks such that:\n",
    "- Every task is assigned to exactly one worker,\n",
    "- No worker is assigned to more than one task,\n",
    "- The total assignment cost is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Problem Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The Assignment Problem appears across a wide range of operational and\n",
    "decision-making contexts where one-to-one matching is required.\n",
    "Typical real-world applications include assigning workers to jobs,\n",
    "machines to tasks, drivers to delivery routes, reviewers to submitted papers,\n",
    "and technicians to service requests.\n",
